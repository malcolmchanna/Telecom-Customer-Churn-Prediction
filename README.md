<h1>Telecom Customer Churn Prediction<h1>
This project aims to build a churn prediction model for a telecom company using the Telecom Customer Churn Dataset. The dataset contains information about customers who left within the last month, customers who stayed, and the services that they subscribed to.

The project involves performing data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a machine learning model to predict customer churn. The project code is written in Python and uses popular data manipulation libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.
